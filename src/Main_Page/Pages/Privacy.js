              <span class="bold">iv.</span> RBL also automatically receives and
              tracks certain data about your mobile device (such as your
              device-type, installed software and language preference) or
              desktop interface; and may create a unique device or user ID for
              you. In some cases, RBL can automatically detect or infer your
              location using GPS, your IP address, etc., but often your
              operating system will require you to grant RBL permission to
              access your GPS settings; please refer to your device’s system
              settings regarding location services.
