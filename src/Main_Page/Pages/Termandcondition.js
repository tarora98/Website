                    mentioned on the User's photo identification document
                    should correspond with the name provided by the User at
                    the time of registration on WinZO, as well as the name and
                    address existing in the records of the User's bank account
                    as provided to WinZO. In the event that no bank account
                    has been registered by the User against such User's
                    account with WinZO, or the User has not verified his/her

                    his/her User Account by the Request date, WinZO shall be
                    entitled to forfeit any amounts subject to transfer.
                    Failure to provide WinZO with a valid bank account or
                    valid identification documents (to WinZO's satisfaction)

                    Further, in order to conduct promotional activities, WinZO
                    may gratuitously issue Bonus points (Called as Cash Bonus)
                    to the User for the purpose of participation in any
                    Contest(s) and no User shall be permitted to transfer or
                    request the transfer of any amount in to the Cash Bonus .
                    The usage of any points issued shall be subject to the
                    limitations and restrictions, including without
                    limitation, restrictions as to time within which such
                    points must be used, as applied by WinZO and notified to
                    the User at the time of issue of such amount. The issue of
                    any points to the user is subject to the sole discretion
                    of WinZO and cannot be demanded by any User as a matter of
                    right. The issue of any such amount by WinZO on any day
                    shall not entitle the user to demand the issuance of such
                    amount at any subsequent period in time nor create an
                    expectation of recurring issue of such amount by WinZO to
                    such User. The bonus points/Cash Bonus granted to the user
                    may be used by such User for the purpose of setting off
                    against the contribution to prize pool in any Contest, in
                    accordance with these Terms and Conditions. The bonus
                    points shall not be withdraw-able or transferrable to any
                    other account of the User, including the bank account of
                    such User, or of any other User or person, other that as
                    part of the winnings of a User in any Contest(s). In case
                    the User terminates his/her account with WinZO or such
                    account if terminated by WinZO, all bonus points granted
                    to the user shall return to WinZO and the User shall not
                    have any right or interest on such points.
